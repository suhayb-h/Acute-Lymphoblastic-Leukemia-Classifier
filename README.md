# Leukemia-Classifier

This project details the creation of an Image classifier model to differentiate ALL lymphoblasts from normal lymphoblasts.

## Notebook Index:

Notebook 1 - 1_ALL _EDA

Notebook 2 - 2_Logistic_Regression_CNN

Notebook 3 - ResNet50V2

#### Future Notebook Plans:

Notebook 4: TensorFlow Decision Forrest -> Experimental model. Issues using the model with data generators

Notebook 5: R Logistic Regression -> No data generators in R, researching for alternatives

Notebook 6: Pytorch CNN -> Should provide similar performance as notebook 2. PyTorch is more widely used in academic environments.

Notebook 7: Attentive Recurrent Comparitor Model -> Theoretically promising

## Image directory restructuring: 

This restructuring is necessary for the notebooks to run appropriately.
