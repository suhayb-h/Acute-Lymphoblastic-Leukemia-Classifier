# Leukemia-Classifier

This project details the creation of an Image classifier model to differentiate ALL lymphoblasts from normal lymphoblasts. This project was accepted to take part in the 2022 American Medical Association Research Competition and Symposium from October 20th till October 22nd.

## Notebook Index:

Notebook 1 - 1_ALL_EDA
This notebook details initial exploratory data analysis of the ISBC 2019 image dataset.

Notebook 2 - 2_Logistic_Regression_CNN
This notebook details the initial 2 neural network models. The first is an untrainable simple logistic regression model. The second is a CNN model comprised of three layers.

Notebook 3 - ResNet50V2
This notebook details the results of a more advanced neural network model.

#### Future Notebook Plans:

Notebook 4: Attentive Recurrent Comparitor Model

## Image directory restructuring: 

This restructuring is necessary for the notebooks within this project to run appropriately. The testing data folder was deleted and all images were placed in a single folder as opposed to be separated into "folds".

Original folder structure:
